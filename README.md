# WebGL Raytracer
A simple realtime raytracer made with JavaScript and WebGL. Requires browser with WebGL 2.0 support (Edge Chromium gives best peformance) and a somewhat powerful GPU.

View demo in here: https://jassenousiainen.github.io/webgl-raytracer/

The ray tracing happens completely in the fragment shader, which is found in the file `fragment.glsl`. The vertex shader only calculates the origin and direction of the rays.
The program uses no vertex buffers, instead it uses the indices of the three vertices of the fullscreen triangle.

## Features
- Fully realtime ray-traced. Rasterization is only used for the full screen triangle.
- Free-fly perspective camera, use WASD -keys to move and click right mousebutton to enable looking around.
- Intersection for sphere and plane primitives (and rectangles with currently only fixed direction)
- Supports point lights and rectangle area lights with customizable size
- Smooth shadows for area lights with customizable number of samples (uses dynamic sampling)
- Mirror reflections with customizable number of bounces (also GI in reflections)
- Phong shading model for direct diffuse/specular illumination and GGX for rough surfaces
- Indirect illumination using Monte Carlo sampling with customizable number of samples and per-material roughness factor
- Monte Carlo importance sampling: fibonacci sphere for lambertian diffuse surfaces and VNDF for GGX surfaces
- Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA)
- ACES tonemapping
